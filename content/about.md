## Know about me:

Previously I have worked with Capgemini as an Associate Consultant for 2 years and 10 months. During my stint at Capgemini, I heard a lot about the Data Science field and how interesting it is, did a bit research about this field and hence decided to pursue my career in Data Science.

I started this personal blog with a purpose to augment my own understanding about new concepts that I learn and also help others learn about them. I also write for publications on Medium like Analytics Vidhya.
